In the Twitter (TwADR-L) dataset, on average 8.62% of the test set had an overlap with the training data in the same fold.

Table II shows the statistics of the new dataset (after removing duplicates). The Twitter data set had 3,157 unique phrase-label pairs and 2,220 unique labels (medical concepts) while 173 phrases had multiple labels (i.e., they were assigned to more than one label). Many concepts had only one example, and the concept that had the most number\n",
